8,Show,work,Work,"
Everyone who works in the Netherlands has the same labour rights, also if you do not have a legal status. As income is needed to support your daily life, we understand that a job is sometimes needed. In case you do have a job, you still have labour rights (minimum wage, payment during illness, days off) and have the rights to get protection when you are unsafe/exploited. 
If you work without a residence permit or passport, you have labour rights just like everyone in the Netherlands. Labour rights are human rights and they apply to everyone, regardless of your residence status. Therefore they also apply to you, even if you work in the informal sector or without a contract.
 
If you are forced to work onder bad conditions and you earn little money, ask for help!
