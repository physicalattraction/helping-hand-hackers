You: Where can I sleep tonight?

Bot: That depends on your circumstances and location.  To best help you, I need some more information.  However, here are some possibilities based on my knowledge base:

* **If you are in Rotterdam and received a negative asylum decision:**  You can contact LVV Rotterdam. They might be able to help you find 24-hour shelter.  [shelter/night-shelter/lvv-rotterdam]  Phone: 14 010. Email: vreemdelingenloketMO@rotterdam.nl
* **If it's very cold and you're in Delft:** The winter cold shelter may be open.  It opens on January 31st and is for anyone experiencing homelessness. [shelter/night-shelter/winter-shelter-delft] Phone: (+)31 1 52 84 10 68. Email: info@perspektief.nl
* **If it's very cold and you are in The Hague:** The winter night shelter in The Hague might be an option, but it only opens when temperatures are dangerously low and opens on January 31st. [shelter/night-shelter/winter-shelter]  (Note: Phone and email are currently unknown.)
* **If you need a night shelter and none of the above apply:** I don't currently have information on other night shelters.  You may wish to try contacting the Red Cross helpline [where-to-go-first/go-first/helpline] to see if they can assist you in finding a place to sleep.
Please provide me with more information about your location and situation, so I can offer more targeted advice.
